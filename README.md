# Machine-Learning-following-Andrew-Ng-Stanford
This repository contains most of the course works written by me when I was studying a very popular Machine Learning Course provided by Andrew Ng with Stanford University. The course is provided by Coursera, and you can find it here: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-course/home/welcome](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-course/home/welcome)
